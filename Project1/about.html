<h3>Aquarius - The Water Bearer</h3>

<p>January 20 - February 18</p>

<p>Element: Air</p>

<p>Ruler: Uranus and Saturn</p>

<p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Leo and Sagittarius</p>

<p>Strengths: progressive, original, independent, humanitarian</p>

<p>Weaknesses: runs from emotional expression, temperamental, uncompromising, aloof</p>

<p>
  Aquarius-born are shy and quiet ,
  but on the other hand they can be
  eccentric and energetic. However,
  in both cases, they are deep thinkers
  and highly intellectual people who love
  helping others. They are able to see without
  prejudice, on both sides, which makes
  them people who can easily solve problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although they can easily adapt to the
    energy that surrounds them, Aquarius-born
    have a deep need to be some time alone
    and away from everything, in order to
    restore power. People born under the
    Aquarius sign, look at the world as a
    place full of possibilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Aquarius is an air sign, and as such,
      uses his mind at every opportunity.
      If there is no mental stimulation,
      they are bored and lack a motivation
      to achieve the best result.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ruling planet of Aquarius, Uranus
        has a timid, abrupt and sometimes
        aggressive nature, but it also gives
        Aquarius visionary quality. They are
        capable of perceiving the future and
        they know exactly what they want to
        be doing five or ten years from now.
        </p>

      <p>
        Uranus also gave them the power of
        quick and easy transformation, so
        they are known as thinkers,
        progressives and humanists. They
        feel good in a group or a community,
        so they constantly strive to be
        surrounded by other people.
        </p>

      <p>
        The biggest problem for Aquarius-born
        is the feeling that they are limited
        or constrained. Because of the desire
        for freedom and equality for all, they
        will always strive to ensure freedom of
        speech and movement. Aquarius-born have
        a reputation for being cold and insensitive
        persons, but this is just their defense
        mechanism against premature intimacy.
        They need to learn to trust others and
        express their emotions in a healthy way.
