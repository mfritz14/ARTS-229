<h3>Aquarius - The Water Bearer</h3>

<p>January 20 - February 18</p>

<p>Element: Air</p>

<p>Ruler: Uranus and Saturn</p>

<p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Leo and Sagittarius</p>

<p>Strengths: progressive, original, independent, humanitarian</p>

<p>Weaknesses: runs from emotional expression, temperamental, uncompromising, aloof</p>

<p>
  With a good sense of humor, the Aquarius-born
  love to share a joke and lighten the atmosphere
  wherever they go. What appeals to them a lot are
  humanitarian activities. They try their best to
  do whatever is possible to make the world a better
  place to live in. The Aquarius-born people are
  intelligent and always look for intellectual
  stimulation. They are known for their wide-ranging
  interests. Monotony bores the Aquarius-born, which
  is why they make conscious efforts to think out of
  the box and do their work in creative ways. These
  people prefer to be financially and emotionally
  independent, and any attempts to pin them to a
  specific situation will make them avoid it.
  They are so popular because they are loyal to
  their friends and loved ones.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is very difficult to predict what the
  Aquarius-born will do next. They will never follow
  a fixed behavioral pattern. These people can be
  very inconsistent and their performance depends
  greatly on their feeling at any given time.
  Their philosophy in life is to live and let
  live, and they will not let anyone get close
  to their hearts beyond a point. They are scared
  of losing their freedom. Although they are good
  listeners, it is very difficult to make the
  Aquarius-born change their pattern of thinking.
  These people tend to cut themselves off from others
  whenever they wish, and become distant. Thus, they
  can miss out on some good opportunities.

    <h3>Pisces - The Fish</h3>

    <p>February 19 - March 20</p>

    <p>Element: Water</p>

    <p>Ruler: Neptune and Jupiter</p>

    <p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Virgo and Taurus</p>

    <p>Strengths: compassionate, artistic, intuitive, gentle, wise, musical</p>

    <p>Weaknesses: fearful, overly trusting, sad, desire to escape reality, can be a victim or a martyr</p>

<p>
  These natives are very creative and imaginative,
  and they can think abstract and come up with
  out-of-the-box ideas. Their powers of imagination
  can help them scale great heights. They are very
  soft people who will treat others exactly as they
  want others to treat them. The people born under
  this Sign are always in a helpful mood. As they
  can feel for others, they always sympathize with
  others and try to help them out. They are very
  intuitive. More than rational reasoning, facts
  and figures, they rely on their intuition while
  taking a decision. Affectionate and gentle, they
  are very sensitive. If there is a setback, it
  affects them deeply, and they develop extreme
  feelings regarding the matter. A Fish will go
  out of his way to help others. However, their
  selfless deeds may not always be recognized by others.

  </p>

  <p>
  They tend to be escapists. When things go wrong,
  they will blame it on their bad luck or
  something else and avoid dealing with it fair
  and square. They are very fussy about how things
  should be. Since they are very idealistic,
  sometimes even the best work can seem mediocre
  to them. They get hurt and demoralized very easily.
  Even with all the talent and resources they
  possess, their low self-esteem becomes a hindrance
  in their path. The Fish tend to make a mountain
  out of a molehill. They take everything to heart
  and become emotional in the extremes. If things
  don't turn out as per their expectations, the
  Fish can lose the motivation to carry on. They
  tend to look at the negative side more than the
  positive side of things. The Fish can be very
  lazy about things that don't matter to them.
  Their enthusiasm and energy levels last only
  for a short time.

    <h3>Aries - The Ram</h3>

    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>

    <p>Element: Fire</p>

    <p>Ruler: Mars</p>

    <p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Libra and Leo</p>

    <p>Strengths: courageous, determined, confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest, passionate</p>

    <p>Weaknesses: impatient, moody, short-tempered, impulsive, aggressive</p>

<p>
  Not the ones to shy away from taking risks, the
  Aries at times push their luck just for that
  adrenalin rush. When the going gets tough, the
  Aries get going! No matter how difficult the
  situation may be, an Aries will take the challenge
  head on. Since they always look for excitement
  and adventures, the Aries are often the ones
  who'd try out newer things in life. You will
  never find an Aries low on energy levels. So,
  when an Aries is around, you will definitely
  feel the whole environment in the room lightening
  up. The positive energy that the Aries possess
  and spread around not only gives them a psychological
  advantage over others, but also makes them quite
  a popular lot in the social circles. If they are
  interested in something, be it a relationship or
  a project, the Aries will be passionately into it
  and be an inspiration for others.
</p>

<p>
A belief that what they know and perceive is right
make them insensitive of others' emotions and arrogant.
The fiery Aries have fixed opinions and they will not
budge for anything in the world. Their stubbornness
make them very difficult people to deal with. In fact
they are both impulsive and impatient, and hence many
a times the Aries will not consider minute aspect of
the matters and think through the situations to arrive
at a decision. Yes, the Aries enthusiastic and active,
but their energies are, more often than not, scattered
in different directions. They need to harness their
energy levels and be disciplined in order to succeed
in life. The Aries will not think twice before being
confrontational and asking questions that may potentially
harm the relationship. Learning a lesson or two on human
relations may be helpful. Aries can't concentrate on
projects for long, and in turn leave them mid-way, in
search of yet another challenge/ task. If you have a
concern regarding your Career, we suggest you don't
just rely on a Sun Sign based assessment.

    <h3>Taurus - The Bull</h3>

    <p>April 20 - May 20</p>

    <p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Cancer and Scorpio</p>

    <p>Strengths: reliable, patient, practical, devoted, responsible, stable</p>

    <p>Weaknesses: stubborn, possessive, uncompromising</p>

<p>
  Known for being reliable, practical, ambitious
  and sensual, the people born under the Zodiac
  Sign Taurus have an eye for beauty. They tend
  to be good with finances, and hence, make efficient
  financial managers. The Taurus will readily lend
  a helping hand to the family, friends and the needy
  even if it means that they would have to endure
  hardship or loss. You can count on the Taurus,
  they will not leave you disappointed. Their
  dependability makes them excellent employees
  and friends. These reliable and sensible souls
  are quite down to earth, polite and pleasant
  personalities. Success rarely goes to their heads.
  Patience is a virtue and the Taurus posses it
  aplenty. They believe in doing the job right
  rather than being the first one to do the job.
  Financially and emotionally, the Taurus prefer to
  be independent and strong so that they don’t have
  to look for support when life throws lemons at them.
  Once they set their eyes on something, the Taurus
  will persistently put in all the efforts to get it.
  Failures and setbacks rarely dampen their spirits.
</p>

<p>
  Although easy going and respectful, the Taurus
  can be unbelievably stubborn and inflexible in
  their approach. So much so that when the logical
  arguments don’t suit them, they will just refuse
  to listen. The Taurus are so goal-oriented that
  they often form a notion that the world revolves
  around them. Their self-indulgent streak makes
  them rude, and ignorant of others’ emotions.
  While they are patient, they are also lazy,
  especially when ordered to do something. The
  Taurus will not move a muscle till they are
  motivated to get up and work. In their bid to
  secure their future and maintain a certain
  image in the society, the Taurus tend to become
  materialistic. While it is good to value money,
  the Taurus-born sometimes takes it too far and
  become frugal in the name of savings and building
  a better future.

    </p>

    <p>
      Gemini-born are so sharp and prompt that it is hard
      for them to stay interested and focused in the
      projects they start with. Such inconsistency is
      their main drawback. They are often tagged as
      superficial people because of their inability to
      delve deep and pay attention to details.
      Gemini-born are constantly in two minds whenever
      they are supposed to decide on something. At times,
      they lose out on very lucrative opportunities
      in their life due to their inability to decide.
      Gemini-born often lack the direction and focus in
      their life and so they easily get bored with the
      things that they are doing. They are full of energy,
      but have a tendency to bite off more than they can
      chew. This leads to anxiousness and makes them erratic.
