  <div class="AquariusContent">
<h3>Aquarius - The Water Bearer</h3>

<p>January 20 - February 18</p>

<p>Element: Air</p>

<p>Ruler: Uranus and Saturn</p>

<p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Leo and Gemini</p>

<p>Strengths: progressive, original, independent, humanitarian</p>

<p>Weaknesses: runs from emotional expression, temperamental, uncompromising, aloof</p>

<p>
  With a good sense of humor, the Aquarius-born
  love to share a joke and lighten the atmosphere
  wherever they go. What appeals to them a lot are
  humanitarian activities. They try their best to
  do whatever is possible to make the world a better
  place to live in. The Aquarius-born people are
  intelligent and always look for intellectual
  stimulation. They are known for their wide-ranging
  interests. Monotony bores the Aquarius-born, which
  is why they make conscious efforts to think out of
  the box and do their work in creative ways. These
  people prefer to be financially and emotionally
  independent, and any attempts to pin them to a
  specific situation will make them avoid it.
  They are so popular because they are loyal to
  their friends and loved ones.
  </p>

  <p>
  It is very difficult to predict what the
  Aquarius-born will do next. They will never follow
  a fixed behavioral pattern. These people can be
  very inconsistent and their performance depends
  greatly on their feeling at any given time.
  Their philosophy in life is to live and let
  live, and they will not let anyone get close
  to their hearts beyond a point. They are scared
  of losing their freedom. Although they are good
  listeners, it is very difficult to make the
  Aquarius-born change their pattern of thinking.
  These people tend to cut themselves off from others
  whenever they wish, and become distant. Thus, they
  can miss out on some good opportunities.
    </p>

    <h3>Pisces - The Fish</h3>

    <p>February 19 - March 20</p>

    <p>Element: Water</p>

    <p>Ruler: Neptune and Jupiter</p>

    <p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Virgo and Taurus</p>

    <p>Strengths: compassionate, artistic, intuitive, gentle, wise, musical</p>

    <p>Weaknesses: fearful, overly trusting, sad, desire to escape reality, can be a victim or a martyr</p>

<p>
  These natives are very creative and imaginative,
  and they can think abstract and come up with
  out-of-the-box ideas. Their powers of imagination
  can help them scale great heights. They are very
  soft people who will treat others exactly as they
  want others to treat them. The people born under
  this Sign are always in a helpful mood. As they
  can feel for others, they always sympathize with
  others and try to help them out. They are very
  intuitive. More than rational reasoning, facts
  and figures, they rely on their intuition while
  taking a decision. Affectionate and gentle, they
  are very sensitive. If there is a setback, it
  affects them deeply, and they develop extreme
  feelings regarding the matter. A Fish will go
  out of his way to help others. However, their
  selfless deeds may not always be recognized by others.

  </p>

  <p>
  They tend to be escapists. When things go wrong,
  they will blame it on their bad luck or
  something else and avoid dealing with it fair
  and square. They are very fussy about how things
  should be. Since they are very idealistic,
  sometimes even the best work can seem mediocre
  to them. They get hurt and demoralized very easily.
  Even with all the talent and resources they
  possess, their low self-esteem becomes a hindrance
  in their path. The Fish tend to make a mountain
  out of a molehill. They take everything to heart
  and become emotional in the extremes. If things
  don't turn out as per their expectations, the
  Fish can lose the motivation to carry on. They
  tend to look at the negative side more than the
  positive side of things. The Fish can be very
  lazy about things that don't matter to them.
  Their enthusiasm and energy levels last only
  for a short time.

    <h3>Aries - The Ram</h3>

    <p>March 21 - April 19</p>

    <p>Element: Fire</p>

    <p>Ruler: Mars</p>

    <p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Sagittarius and Leo</p>

    <p>Strengths: courageous, determined, confident, enthusiastic, optimistic, honest, passionate</p>

    <p>Weaknesses: impatient, moody, short-tempered, impulsive, aggressive</p>

<p>
  Not the ones to shy away from taking risks, the
  Aries at times push their luck just for that
  adrenalin rush. When the going gets tough, the
  Aries get going! No matter how difficult the
  situation may be, an Aries will take the challenge
  head on. Since they always look for excitement
  and adventures, the Aries are often the ones
  who'd try out newer things in life. You will
  never find an Aries low on energy levels. So,
  when an Aries is around, you will definitely
  feel the whole environment in the room lightening
  up. The positive energy that the Aries possess
  and spread around not only gives them a psychological
  advantage over others, but also makes them quite
  a popular lot in the social circles. If they are
  interested in something, be it a relationship or
  a project, the Aries will be passionately into it
  and be an inspiration for others.
</p>

<p>
A belief that what they know and perceive is right
make them insensitive of others' emotions and arrogant.
The fiery Aries have fixed opinions and they will not
budge for anything in the world. Their stubbornness
make them very difficult people to deal with. In fact
they are both impulsive and impatient, and hence many
a times the Aries will not consider minute aspect of
the matters and think through the situations to arrive
at a decision. Yes, the Aries enthusiastic and active,
but their energies are, more often than not, scattered
in different directions. They need to harness their
energy levels and be disciplined in order to succeed
in life. The Aries will not think twice before being
confrontational and asking questions that may potentially
harm the relationship. Learning a lesson or two on human
relations may be helpful. Aries can't concentrate on
projects for long, and in turn leave them mid-way, in
search of yet another challenge/ task. If you have a
concern regarding your Career, we suggest you don't
just rely on a Sun Sign based assessment.

  and friends. These reliable and sensible souls
  are quite down to earth, polite and pleasant
  personalities. Success rarely goes to their heads.
  Patience is a virtue and the Taurus posses it
  aplenty. They believe in doing the job right
  rather than being the first one to do the job.
  Financially and emotionally, the Taurus prefer to
  be independent and strong so that they don’t have
  to look for support when life throws lemons at them.
  Once they set their eyes on something, the Taurus
  will persistently put in all the efforts to get it.
  Failures and setbacks rarely dampen their spirits.
</p>

<p>
  Although easy going and respectful, the Taurus
  can be unbelievably stubborn and inflexible in
  their approach. So much so that when the logical
  arguments don’t suit them, they will just refuse
  to listen. The Taurus are so goal-oriented that
  they often form a notion that the world revolves
  around them. Their self-indulgent streak makes
  them rude, and ignorant of others’ emotions.
  While they are patient, they are also lazy,
  especially when ordered to do something. The
  Taurus will not move a muscle till they are
  motivated to get up and work. In their bid to
  secure their future and maintain a certain
  image in the society, the Taurus tend to become
  materialistic. While it is good to value money,
  the Taurus-born sometimes takes it too far and
  become frugal in the name of savings and building
  a better future.

    <p>
      Gemini-born personalities are expressive, clever,
      quick-witted, intellectual and fun people but they
      can also be tense and restless. Broad-minded and
      easy-going that they are, the Gemini are adjustable
      individuals as the desire to enjoy every moment run
      deep within them. A wide variety of subjects excites

      intellectuals, they are always interested in learning
      numerous subjects. They are clever and sharp individuals

    </p>

    <p>
      Gemini-born are so sharp and prompt that it is hard
      for them to stay interested and focused in the
      projects they start with. Such inconsistency is
      their main drawback. They are often tagged as
      superficial people because of their inability to
      delve deep and pay attention to details.
      Gemini-born are constantly in two minds whenever
      they are supposed to decide on something. At times,
      they lose out on very lucrative opportunities
      in their life due to their inability to decide.
      Gemini-born often lack the direction and focus in
      their life and so they easily get bored with the
      things that they are doing. They are full of energy,
      but have a tendency to bite off more than they can
      chew. This leads to anxiousness and makes them erratic.

  sign natives are mostly the family types. The Crabs love
  to be in a familiar surroundings and nurture their
  relationships. The Crabs can come up with brilliant
  and novel ideas using their imaginative powers. However,
  in the process they can end up with ideas that may not
  be too practical, or may be too over-ambitious. The power
  to think and act spontaneously is a major guiding force
  for a Cancer-born, and more than reasoning, they rely on
  their intuition for taking decisions. Sensitive as they
  are, Cancer-born are faithful and generous towards others,
  and they hardly expect anything in return for their
  generosity and faithfulness. The Cancer-born natives

  the people around them. They can easily get bogged down by
  setbacks and failures. It is observed that the Cancer
  natives are prone to pessimism. This is their typical
  characteristic. The Cancer natives find it difficult to
  let go of things close to their heart, and hence, they
  find it difficult to look beyond the imperfections and
  move on. Cancer-born are inclined to carry imaginary
  hurts and setbacks along with them. This is because of
  their overemotional nature, which can create highly
  unsettling conditions for them. Cancer-born individuals

  specific habit is producing may distance people from
  them, especially their near and dear ones.

      Sign Leo are quite frank about what they want to say. Mincing
      words is not their thing. While they demand loyalty from the
      people associated with them, the Leo themselves are also loyal
      and trustworthy individuals.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Leo are opinionated and headstrong, and it takes a lot
      of convincing to make them change their stance. They have a
      huge and fragile ego, which often gets hurt over trivial
      matters. Their ego sometimes become a hurdle in their path

      anxiety and even failures and disappointments. They tend to
      become so self-centered at times that they would become harsh
      and say things without considering the fact that they would hurt someone.

    <h3>Virgo - The Virgin</h3>

    <p>August 23 – September 22</p>

    <p>Element: Earth</p>

    <p>Ruler: Mercury</p>

    <p>Greatest Overall Compatibility: Pisces and Cancer and Capricorn</p>

    <p>Strengths: loyal, analytical, kind, hardworking, practical</p>

      Virgo personality include analytical, intelligence, modest,
      capable, dedicated, humble, wise, witty and well spoken.
      Quite undemonstrative and introvert, the Virgo-born represent
      waters that run deep. The Virgo have a good understanding of
      human nature and can effectively help people solve their problems.
      No detail, regardless of how small or big it is, can escape the
      watchful eyes of a Virgo-born. Their attention to detail is
      praiseworthy. The Virgo are an intelligent lot, who would love
      to know about various subjects and increase their general
      knowledge. They don't believe in living in the fantasy world
      and will be very much in touch with the reality. Their practical
      approach is one of their biggest strength. The Virgo possess an
      analytical mind and see things in black and white. They are
      capable of producing a clear analysis and thereby a solution
      of even the most complicated problems. You can trust a Virgo
      for following the instructions and trying his best to do the
      job well. Besides, he is a rational person and would not let
      emotions affect his decisions. Since they are goal-oriented,
      perfectionists, rational and reliable, it is very likely that
      they are great achievers too. But you will rarely see them
      boasting about their accomplishments.
    </p>

    <p>
      They have such a clear picture in their minds as to how
      things should be, the Virgo tend to be overcritical and
      lose the plot in the process. The Virgo-born often get
      lost in details and they will not have a peace of mind
      till they resolve all the issues. Besides, their strong
      likes and dislikes make them quite fussy. Pleasing or
      impressing a Virgo is tough job, as anything less than
      perfect (in their eyes) does not make the cut. They call
      a spade a spade and they don't sugar-coat their opinions
      before putting them across. Their harshness does not always
      go down well with the people around them. The Virgo are
      conservative and won't readily accept modern ideas. Maybe
      it has to do with their need to test the waters and be
      sure of the outcome.The Virgo-born are criticized for
      being judgemental. They cannot ignore faults and mistakes
      as anything less than perfect is not good enough for them.

      The people born under the Sign Libra are kind, gentle and lovers of
      beauty, harmony and peace. However, in their effort to keep everyone
      happy, they find it difficult to say 'NO' to anyone, and as a result,
      they end up getting stressed. The Libra-born natives are experts at
      getting things done, but they cannot be called cunning. They are too
      good to exploit the emotions of other people. Their ruling planet is
      Venus, and they are extremely romantic people. Whatever they do in
      life is driven by the feelings of love. They have a very pleasing
      manner of talking and also choose pleasant subjects to talk about,
      which makes people feel happy in their company. They have a strong
      sense of justice and fair play. They may skillfully find their way
      out, but they will never resort to cunning methods to get what they
      want. They are well-known for their diplomatic skills and have the
      ability to listen to differing points of view with a great deal of
      patience. The Scales will never go to extremes, and will mostly
      choose the middle path in order to please everyone around them,
      whatever the issues may be.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Libra-born can easily get carried away by outer beauty,
      to the extent that they may ignore the beautiful inner qualities
      of other people. People born under the Zodiac Sign Libra are
      firm and strong, but they can also be detached and pretend to
      be pleasant sometimes as they don't wish to displease anyone.
      A Libra native can easily be influenced by the views of other
      people and are prone to keep changing their minds. If is
      difficult to understand whether they will keep their promises.
      The Scales, though mostly energetic, can sometimes be lazy
      and may tend to take things easy. It is not physical laziness,
      but they wish to avoid any kind of stress or emotional challenges.
      One of the most difficult things for a Libra is to take a decision.
      When faced with a choice, it is very tough for them to select what
      is best for them, which can become a big hurdle in their path.
      Because they have a strong desire for material comforts, they may
      tend to waste a lot of money in unnecessary luxuries.

      Capricorn signifies stability, balance and wisdom. People
      born under this Sign are also known as the Goats. They are
      sensitive, sensible and secure in their own space. They do
      not take impulsive decisions but will act aggressively to
      get what they want. But they have some negative points
      too. Known for their practical approach, the Capricorn
      natives apply their intelligence and logic and take into
      account all the facts before making any decisions.
      The Capricorn-born people are self-confident, have big
      goals and put in their best efforts to achieve them.
      They are ambitious because they want a secure future
      for themselves and their families. These people are mature,
      sensible and don't get carried away by fantasies. Their
      friends have faith in their judgement and frequently
      seek their advice. The Goats are disciplined and have
      a lot of respect for those who are focussed on their
      goals. You will never find them dealing with important
      matters casually. Once they set their hearts on some goal,
      they immediately set out to achieve it. They have lots
      of patience and understand that things take time to
      materialize. They are not impulsive, and will never
      take a risk or do anything that has the potential to
      upset their lives. They are very cautious about stability.

      The Goats are prone to becoming pessimistic because
      they find it difficult to go against the odds. No matter
      how much they achieve, they always think of themselves
      as under-achievers. Those who are born under the Zodiac
      Sign Capricorn have a strong feeling that their
      decisions and methods are perfect, and will rarely
      change their views. They are good at communications
      but are fundamentally shy people and normally take
      their own sweet time to open up to the best of friends.
      They are very conscious of how events will affect them,
      and this preoccupation with themselves make people think
      they are selfish. The Capricorn can be very detached
      people who will not get close to others beyond a certain
      point. Emotional involvement doesn't come easily to
      them. The Goats can be witty and funny at one moment
      and grumpy at the very next. These mood swings can
      make them behave irresponsibly which can ruin things.
